# python-sqlalchemy-dual-db-connection

## Description

This repository contains a Python script showcasing how to connect to two different SQL databases simultaneously using SQLAlchemy. The script demonstrates the setup of SQLAlchemy engine objects for each database, the definition of database models, and the creation of sessions to interact with the databases.

### Key Features
- Establishing connections to multiple SQL databases using SQLAlchemy.
- Creating and defining models for each database.
- Illustrating the use of sessions to perform operations on both databases independently.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Update the database URLs in the script with your actual database connection details.
3. Run the script to see how SQLAlchemy manages connections to two databases seamlessly.

## Dependencies
